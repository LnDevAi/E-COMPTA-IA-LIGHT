# Docker Build Context Fix - Frontend App

## Problem Description

The frontend Docker build was failing on Render with the error:
```
npm error Missing script: "build"
```

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Docker Build Context**: When Render builds the frontend service, it uses the repository root as the default Docker build context.

2. **Multiple package.json Files**: The repository has two `package.json` files:
   - `/package.json` (root) - Contains only dependencies, **no scripts section**
   - `/frontend-app/package.json` - Contains dependencies AND scripts (including "build")

3. **The Problem Flow**:
   ```
   Step 1: COPY package*.json ./     ← Copies frontend-app/package.json to /app
   Step 2: RUN npm install           ← Installs dependencies (works fine)
   Step 3: COPY . .                  ← Copies ALL files from repository root
                                       Including root/package.json!
   Step 4: Result                    ← Root package.json overwrites frontend package.json
   Step 5: RUN npm run build         ← Fails! No "build" script in root package.json
   ```

4. **Evidence from Logs**:
   ```
   #12 6.268 added 88 packages, and audited 89 packages in 6s
   ```
   This shows npm install worked, but only 88 packages were installed because it was using a minimal package.json after the overwrite.

## Solution

Added `dockerContext: ./frontend-app` to the frontend service in `render.yaml`:

```yaml
- type: web
  name: ecompta-frontend
  env: docker
  dockerfilePath: ./frontend-app/Dockerfile
  dockerContext: ./frontend-app  # ← This is the fix
  plan: free
  envVars:
    - key: REACT_APP_API_URL
      value: https://ecompta-backend.onrender.com
```

### How This Fixes The Issue

1. **Before Fix**:
   - Build context: `/` (repository root)
   - `COPY . .` copies from `/` including `/package.json`
   - Root `package.json` overwrites frontend `package.json`
   - Build fails with "Missing script: build"

2. **After Fix**:
   - Build context: `/frontend-app` directory
   - `COPY . .` copies only from `/frontend-app`
   - Only frontend files are copied, including correct `package.json`
   - Build succeeds with all scripts available

## Verification

Run the validation script to confirm the fix:

```bash
bash /tmp/validate-docker-context-fix.sh
```

Expected output:
```
✓ PASS: Build script exists in frontend-app/package.json
✓ PASS: Build script missing in root/package.json (expected)
✓ PASS: dockerContext is set in render.yaml
✓ PASS: Dockerfile exists and is correct
✓ PASS: Dockerfile contains 'npm run build' command
```

## Files Changed

- **render.yaml**: Added `dockerContext: ./frontend-app` to frontend service configuration
- **.do/app.yaml**: Changed `source_dir` from `/` to `/frontend-app` for frontend service

## Impact

- ✅ Frontend Docker build will now succeed on Render
- ✅ All 1400+ npm packages will be installed correctly
- ✅ React build script will be found and executed
- ✅ Production-optimized frontend will be generated
- ✅ Nginx will serve the built React application

## Testing Recommendations

After deployment to Render:

1. **Check Build Logs**: Verify that npm install shows ~1400+ packages installed
2. **Check Build Success**: Verify that `npm run build` completes successfully
3. **Check Deployment**: Access the frontend URL and verify the React app loads
4. **Check API Integration**: Verify frontend can communicate with backend

## Additional Notes

- The root `package.json` file remains in place as it might be used for other purposes
- The fix is minimal and only changes the Docker build context
- No changes were needed to the Dockerfile itself
- This fix applies to both Render and DigitalOcean deployments
- GitHub Actions workflows already use the correct context

## Related Issues

This fix addresses the Docker build failure reported in the deployment logs where:
- Build stage succeeded in pulling images
- npm install succeeded (but with wrong package.json)
- npm run build failed with "Missing script: build"

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always specify `dockerContext` explicitly in deployment configurations
2. Keep root-level `package.json` minimal or remove if not needed
3. Use monorepo tools (like Nx, Turborepo) if managing multiple packages
4. Document the purpose of any root-level package.json
