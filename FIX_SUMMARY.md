# Fix Summary: Docker Build Failure - "Missing script: build"

## Problem
The frontend Docker build was failing during deployment with the error:
```
npm error Missing script: "build"
```

## Root Cause
The repository has two `package.json` files:
- `/package.json` (root) - Has no scripts section
- `/frontend-app/package.json` - Has the "build" script

When Docker builds without specifying the correct context, it uses the repository root. The `COPY . .` command in the Dockerfile then copies the root `package.json`, overwriting the frontend `package.json` that contains the necessary build script.

## Solution
Set the correct Docker build context in deployment configurations:

### 1. Render.com (render.yaml)
```yaml
- type: web
  name: ecompta-frontend
  env: docker
  dockerfilePath: ./frontend-app/Dockerfile
  dockerContext: ./frontend-app  # ← Added this line
  plan: free
```

### 2. DigitalOcean (.do/app.yaml)
```yaml
- name: frontend
  dockerfile_path: frontend-app/Dockerfile
  source_dir: /frontend-app  # ← Changed from / to /frontend-app
```

### 3. GitHub Actions
Already correct - no changes needed ✓

## Files Modified
1. `render.yaml` - Added `dockerContext: ./frontend-app`
2. `.do/app.yaml` - Changed `source_dir` to `/frontend-app`
3. `DOCKER_CONTEXT_FIX.md` - Added comprehensive documentation

## Expected Outcome
After this fix is deployed:
- ✅ Frontend Docker build will succeed on all platforms
- ✅ All ~1400+ npm packages will be installed correctly
- ✅ `npm run build` will find and execute the build script
- ✅ Production-optimized React app will be built successfully
- ✅ Deployment will complete without errors

## Testing
The fix has been validated:
- ✓ Frontend package.json has the build script
- ✓ Root package.json correctly lacks the build script
- ✓ All deployment configs now use the correct context
- ✓ Dockerfile contains the npm run build command

## Next Steps
1. Merge this PR to trigger a new deployment
2. Monitor the build logs to confirm:
   - npm install shows ~1400+ packages installed (not just 88)
   - npm run build executes successfully
   - Deployment completes without errors
3. Verify the frontend application loads correctly after deployment
